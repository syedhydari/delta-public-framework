# Delta Quantitative Risk Management Framework

## Overview

This repository contains the **Delta QRM Framework** - a comprehensive R-based educational toolkit for quantitative risk management designed for Columbia University coursework. The framework provides modern risk analysis tools optimized for use with **Positron IDE**.

## Educational Purpose

This framework is built on the Delta Strategy philosophy and adapted for academic use in quantitative risk management education. It provides students with practical, hands-on experience in:

- Value at Risk (VaR) modeling and analysis
- Portfolio optimization using modern portfolio theory
- Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment
- Factor-based risk modeling (CAPM, multi-factor models)
- Stress testing and scenario analysis

## Quick Start

### For Positron IDE Users

1. **Open Project**: Load `delta-qrm.Rproj` in Positron IDE
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `source("setup_packages.R")`
3. **Start Learning**: Run `source("examples/intro_to_qrm.R")`
4. **Full Analysis**: Run `source("examples/comprehensive_qrm_analysis.R")`
